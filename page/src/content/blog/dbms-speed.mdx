We often get confused when we don't know which databases to use.

In this study I compared the speed of processing of three of the most popular DBMS (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

In this work I used and model with multiple factors: **DBMS, Computer in which the experiment was performed, Query and Portions of the Data**.

I found that DBMS **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite** handle text data faster than **MySQL**.

A more detailed description of my study in the next presentation:
