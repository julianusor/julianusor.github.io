## Introduction

This guide explains the core concepts, agents, and tools available in Claude Code, and shows a practical case of running multiple agents in parallel.

## Key Concepts

- **Memory**: Markdown files with project context. Location: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. Read-only for agents.
- **Skills**: Packaged prompts for common tasks. Location: `~/.claude/skills/`. Invoked like `/skill-name`.
- **Agents / Sub-agents**: Separate Claude instances working in parallel (spawned via Task tool).
- **MCP Servers**: Services that connect Claude to external tools via Model Context Protocol (configured in `~/.claude/mcp.json`).

## Sub-Agent Types (When to Use)

- **General-purpose** — Complex multi-step tasks, research, analysis. (Medium speed)
- **Explore** — Quick codebase/file discovery (Glob, Grep, Read). (Fast)
- **Plan** — Architecture and implementation design before coding. (Medium)
- **Bash** — Run terminal commands when needed. (Fast)

## Tools Overview

- `Read(file_path)` — Read a file.
- `Write(file_path, content)` — Create a new file.
- `Edit(old, new)` — Modify existing files.
- `Glob(pattern)` — Find files by pattern.
- `Grep(pattern)` — Search file contents.
- `Bash(command)` — Run shell commands.
- `Task(subagent_type, prompt)` — Launch sub-agents.
- `WebFetch(url, prompt)` / `WebSearch(query)` — Web interactions.

## Anatomy of an Effective Agent Prompt

Structure your prompt like this:

1. Agent identification: who you are and the project.
2. Objective: a clear, specific goal.
3. Context: relevant project info and files.
4. Deliverables: detailed list of outputs.
5. Output format: exact format required for copy-paste or PR-ready content.

Example (Content Agent):

```
Eres el CONTENT & CONTEXT AGENT para <Project>.

## Objetivo
Reescribir secciones clave para posicionar el sitio como AI-first.

## Contexto
- Archivo: src/routes/(marketing)/+page.svelte
- Servicios actuales: 3 (expandir a 5)

## Tarea
1. Reescribir hero section
2. Actualizar stats

## Formato
Proveer textos exactos listos para pegar.
```

## Case Study: 3 Agents in Parallel

- **Task 1 — Content Agent**: Update copy to position as AI experts.
- **Task 2 — Brand Protection Agent**: Audit brand, legal, credibility.
- **Task 3 — Programmer Agent**: Review code structure and bugs.

Benefits:

- Speed: parallel execution saved time.
- Specialization: each agent focuses on distinct concerns.
- Full context: agents receive project history and files.

## Effective Patterns

- Division by specialization (content / design / legal).
- Division by file/module (frontend / backend / DB).
- Division by phase (research / design / implementation).

Choose the pattern that fits project size and modularity.

## Tips & Tricks

1. Use agents for broad or multi-file work; do small edits yourself.
2. Parallelize truly independent tasks — avoid parallelizing dependent steps.
3. Agents can access prior conversation history and project files, but not changes made after they start or other agents' live results.

## Full Workflow Example

1. User requests an AI-first homepage.
2. Launch 3 specialized agents in parallel.
3. Agents report results and Claude synthesizes changes.
4. Save reports to `memory/`, commit and push to Git.

## Essential Commands

- `/tasks` — List active tasks.
- `/install <skill>` — Install a skill.
- `/skills` — List available skills.
- `/commit`, `/review-pr <id>` — Common workflow commands.
- `EnterPlanMode()` / `ExitPlanMode()` — For planning sessions.

## Next Steps

- Level 1: Use `Task` for small parallel searches and save findings to memory.
- Level 2: Launch 3 agents for a complex task and create a custom skill.
- Level 3: Design a 5+ agent workflow and integrate a custom MCP server.
